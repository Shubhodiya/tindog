Hello! TinDog was a hands-on project that I created under Angela's guidance from her Web Development Bootcamp.
This website has been created using HTML, CSS and the framework that has been used is Bootstrap. 
This is a practice/dummy project.

You can view the website at https://shubhodiya.github.io/tindog/
